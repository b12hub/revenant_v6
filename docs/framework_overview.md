# Revenant Framework — Complete Architecture Overview

## Framework Vision
Revenant is a modular multi-agent framework designed for cognitive computing and autonomous systems. The architecture follows a layered approach where each series builds upon the capabilities of the previous one, creating a sophisticated hierarchy of specialized intelligence.

## Series Hierarchy

### 🧠 A-Series: Cognitive Foundation
**Role**: Basic cognition and system fundamentals  
**Input**: Raw data, user requests, system events  
**Output**: Structured cognitive state

### 📊 B-Series: Analytical Intelligence  
**Role**: Data analysis and business insight  
**Input**: Structured cognitive state  
**Output**: Analytical insights and business intelligence

### ⚡ C-Series: Specialized Execution
**Role**: Domain-specific operations and expertise  
**Input**: Analytical insights  
**Output**: Operational results and expert assessments

### 🎯 D-Series: Unified Orchestration
**Role**: Multi-agent coordination and fusion  
**Input**: All previous series outputs  
**Output**: Unified decisions and system evaluations
