# A_SERIES Architecture — Revenant Agent Series

## Purpose
Auto-generated documentation for A_SERIES layer.

## Agents
- **DataMinerAgent** — Extracts, enriches, and transforms raw data from multiple sources into structured insights with ETL capabilities.
- **ContextAgent** — Maintains conversation context, manages session state, and provides contextual awareness for other agents.
- **OptimizationAgent** — Continuously analyzes system performance and suggests optimizations for efficiency and cost reduction.
- **AnalyticsAgent** — Analyzes system performance, agent effectiveness, and provides data-driven insights for optimization.
- **ContextAgent** — Maintains conversation context, manages session state, and provides contextual awareness for other agents.
- **DataMinerAgent** — Extracts, enriches, and transforms raw data from multiple sources into structured insights with ETL capabilities.
- **EvolutionAgent** — Continuously analyzes ecosystem performance and drives self-optimization through meta-learning and evolutionary algorithms.
- **OptimizationAgent** — Continuously analyzes system performance and suggests optimizations for efficiency and cost reduction.
- **PlannerAgent** — Strategically orchestrates goal-driven workflows across multiple agents with dependency resolution and failure recovery.
- **SecurityAgent** — Analyzes security threats, validates inputs, and protects the Revenant ecosystem from malicious activity.
- **EvolutionAgent** — Continuously analyzes ecosystem performance and drives self-optimization through meta-learning and evolutionary algorithms.
- **SecurityAgent** — Analyzes security threats, validates inputs, and protects the Revenant ecosystem from malicious activity.
